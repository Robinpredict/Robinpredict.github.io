## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="GRB.jpg">

Hi! I received my BEng degree from Jilin University, China. Then, I received the MSc and Ph.D. degree from  Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I am an Associate Editor at Computers and Electrical Engineering. I am the guest editor of Information Fusion, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, and Frontiers in Marine Science. I am the chair of an invited session at ICONIP 2023/2024.

My Ph.D. was co-supervised by [Prof. Suganthan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yZNzBU0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (IEEE Fellow), [Asst Prof. Yuen Kum Fai](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00720), and [Dr. Okan Duru](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=JT_KdJgAAAAJ&hl=en). You can find the full publication list at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=PrIHu7QAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
